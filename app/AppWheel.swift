//
//  AppWheel.swift
//  HyperVibe
//
//  A radial app launcher, summoned by holding the layer key.
//
//  It appears CENTRED ON THE CURSOR rather than at a fixed spot on screen: the pointer is then
//  already at the middle, so picking is a short flick outward in the app's direction instead of a
//  journey across the display. That matters on a remote whose pad is 27 mm across.
//
//  Selection is by where the CURSOR is, not by where the finger is on the pad — so the trackpad
//  keeps behaving exactly as it always does while the wheel is up, and nothing has to be learned.
//  Select launches what is highlighted; any other button cancels; nothing is highlighted until the
//  pointer leaves a dead zone in the middle, so summoning it and pressing Select does nothing by
//  accident.
